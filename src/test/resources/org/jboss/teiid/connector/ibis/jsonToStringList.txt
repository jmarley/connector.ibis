When the series visited Michigan in June, Ford had only two drivers finish in the top eight, while rival Chevrolet took four of the top six positions. But things went considerably better on Sunday, with Biffle winning the race in a Ford and the manufacturer taking three of the top six positions. It was the 12th career victory for Roush at Michigan, breaking a tie he held with Wood Brothers Racing for the most wins at the track by an owner",
